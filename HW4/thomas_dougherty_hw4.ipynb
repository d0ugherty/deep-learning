    "<p> Transfer learning is the act of training a model for one task (taking a pretrained model) and fine tuning it for another specific task. Transfer learning is a more efficient way of training neural networks because it allows them to use knowledge from the previous task while working with less labeled data. </br>\n",

    "It's like going from a riding a mountain bike to learning how to ride a motorized dirt bike. All the time spent on a mountain bike taught you balance, cornering technique, and riding over rough terrain. Since those previous skills don't have to br learned again, you can focus on things like throttle control and riding at high speed giving you a headstart on the learning process. </p> </br>\n",
